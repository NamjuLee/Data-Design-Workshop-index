Data's importance has led to the new age of design, making holistic design approaches in architectural, landscape, and urban design possible: Optimization, parametric design, data-driven design, and something fundamentally reliant on data. Therefore, the use of data in design is becoming much more significant than ever. Mainly, the change in our life by autonomous vehicles, IoT, blockchain, or smart cities based on 5G technology will accelerate the way of living and thinking, generating and consuming data every day. This lecture shows some snippets of How designers could surf with this new wave
